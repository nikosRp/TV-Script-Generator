## Project TV Script Generator

## Project Overview

In this project, which is part of Udacity's nanodegree program, we are are using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to train a network that will be able to generate TV scripts  


## Getting started

You can review the code and my answers for this project in the dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb file

You can also clone the original project and implement your own solution for this project from [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)

Or simply : 
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
cd deep-learning-v2-pytorch/project-tv-script-generation
```
## Prerequisites
You can see all the prerequisites needed in the requirements.txt file
Or you can install them using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I used Anaconda to create a virtual environment on Windows OS
You can check how to use Anaconda and virtual environments [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

You will also need part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons, which is provided in the data folder

You can run and train this network both on CPU and on GPU.
It is suggested to run on GPU in order to speed up the computational time
